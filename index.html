        <h1> My Favourite Hobby: Swimming</h1>
        <p> My hobby is swimming.The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed. On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat.<br> <br>
            Itâ€™s amazing pushing yourself to the challenge of beating someone else to the finish line and itâ€™s great fun racing across the pool as fast as you can! Trying little tricks like underwater handstands and flips also puts a big smile on my face.

            Another reason that I love swimming is that it has more variety than other sports. Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesnâ€™t feel like youâ€™re stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Adding swimming equipment like flippers, a snorkel or a noodle (a flexible cylindrical piece of foam) changes the experience yet again and can help you develop your swimming technique.</p>
